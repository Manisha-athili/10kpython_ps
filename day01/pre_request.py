#How to declare different types of data typesn.
#Operators
#Conditional statements - If and else statements, elif
#Loops - While, for, jump statements - break, continue 
#Functions - Declaring a function and call a function, return statement usage
#Inbuilt functions - Atleast the most famous once - string and list

# data types



# loops: loops are used to excute block of code multiple times
# 2 main types of loops in python

# for loop: iterate over a sequence
# Syntax : for varible in sequence:
#               code to excute
# example: 
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
    # 0 1 2  3 4

# while: when we wnat to run the code as long as the condition is true
# Syntax : while condition:
#               code to execute

# exmple: 
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count+=1
    # 1 2 3 4 5 .
